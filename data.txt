There's an infestation in my mind's imagination,
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smoking them out the basement,
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop,
Just another attempt to make the voices stop,
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something,
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing,
This doesn't mean I lost my dream,
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean.
Gangsters don't cry,
Therefore, therefore I'm,
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm.
Can you save, can you save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said,
If I didn't know better I'd guess you're all already dead,
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch,
Saying stuff like, "You only live once."
You've got one time to figure it out,
One time to twist and one time to shout,
One time to think and I say we start now,
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about.
Gangsters don't cry,
Therefore, therefore I'm,
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm.
Can you save, can you save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit. [2x]
Can you save, can you save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my—save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my—save my—
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
"I'd die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignored them still
All these questions they're for real
Like "Who would you live for?",
"Who would you die for?"
And "Would you ever kill?"
Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
(help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional
What I wanna save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?
I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat
And repeat yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm not evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional
What I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat
To avoid yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
When the leader of the bad guys sang,
Something soft and soaked in pain,
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway,
He must've forgot to close his door,
As he cranked out those dismal chords,
And his four walls declared him insane.
I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please, take me.
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Three lights are lit but the fourth one's out,
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout,
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house,
So I head out, down a route I think is heading south,
But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt,
And now that my mind's out, and now I hear it clear and loud,
I'm thinking, "Wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house."
I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please,
I don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don't know if this one is about me or the devil.
I don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don't know if this one is about me or the devil.
You're the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no
You're the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please,
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh (You're the judge, oh no, set me free)
Na na na na, oh oh (You're the judge, oh no, set me free)
Na na na na, oh oh (You're the judge, oh no, set me free)
(Josh Dun!)
(You're the judge, oh no, set me free)
